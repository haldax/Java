package c10_ObjectOrientedThinking;/* Stacks have many applications. For example, the compiler uses a stack to process method
invocations. When a method is invoked, its parameters and local variables are pushed into a
stack. When a method calls another method, the new methodâ€™s parameters and local variables
are pushed into the stack. When a method finishes its work and returns to its caller, its associated
space is released from the stack.
You can define a class to model stacks. For simplicity, assume the stack holds the int
values. Thus, name the stack class StackOfIntegers. */
