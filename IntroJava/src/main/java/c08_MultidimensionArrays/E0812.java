(Financial application: compute tax) Rewrite Listing 3.5, ComputeTax.java,
using arrays. For each filing status, there are six tax rates. Each rate is applied
to a certain amount of taxable income. For example, from the taxable income of
$400,000 for a single filer, $8,350 is taxed at 10%, (33,950 - 8,350) at 15%,
